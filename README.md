## What is this

This repo is a collection of my findings about various topics related to web development.
I try to collect and compile as many information as possible.
I collect solutions to common problems, and, hopefully, will conclude that there is a holy grail for every problem.


## Some of the contents include

  - css layouts
  - vertical centering
  - polyfills
  - minimal no dependency as-much-as-possible cross-browser solutions for simple tasks
    like domready listener, dynamic script loading, ...
